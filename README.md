### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Talent is distributed globally but opportunities aren't. I want to change that.

My name is Malik and I dream and fight for a world where anyone can have the freedom to decide who they want to be and what they want to pursue.

Originally from Lisbon. I'm currently building Upframe, the mentor network for accelerators. In addition, I'm studying Product Management at CODE University in Berlin and taking CS50 from Harvard online.
