# Only you know who you can set out to be — Never let anyone tell you otherwise.

My name is Malik, I was born in Lisbon and moved to Berlin where I work in product enablement (what the industry calls Product Manager). In my free time, you can find me building apps, projects, events and communities that **foster connection, enable education and create more access to opportunities**.

### Right Now, I'm:
- 🌐 Working on my capstone project and thesis at [CODE University](https://code.berlin/), exploring computer networks, distributed systems, blockchain and decentralisation. I want to build something that makes the web better and that could have been created at Mozilla or Cloudflare.
- 🌱 Building and maintaining [Logicola](https://logicola.org), an e-learning app, originally created by the late Harry Gensler, so more students can learn formal logic and improve their reasoning.
- ✨ Looking to learn with more seasoned technical PMs and to collaborate in projects that improve the infrustructure of the internet. If you're stumbling upon my profile and feel like grabbing a digital coffee would be energising, please reach out:
