# Only you know who you can set out to be ‚Äî Never let anyone tell you otherwise.

My name is Malik, I was born in Lisbon and moved to Berlin where I work in product enablement (what the industry calls Product Manager). In my free time, you can find me building apps, events and communities that **foster connection, enable education and create more access to opportunities**.

### Right Now, I'm:
- ‚ú® Organising monthly meetups and building the [LisboaJS](https://github.com/lisboajs) and LisboaUX communities. We're always looking for speakers for our talks.
- üçÅ Building Outono.org, a way to find and have coffee with Portuguese people working in tech, anywhere in the world.
- üå± Building and maintaining [Logicola](https://logicola.org), an e-learning platform, originally created by the late Harry Gensler, so more students can learn formal logic and improve their reasoning.
  
‚ú® Looking to learn with more seasoned technical PMs and to collaborate in projects that touch computer networks, distributed systems, blockchain and decentralisation. I want to build something that makes the web better and improves internet infrustructure. If you're stumbling upon my profile and feel like grabbing a digital coffee would be energising, please reach out:
